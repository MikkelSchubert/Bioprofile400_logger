# Bioprofile400_logger
Simple script to read the serial data stream from the Bioprofile400 and log the data to file.  
  
Connect Bioprofile to computer via "USB to Serial port" and then "serial to parralel" and then some sort of null modem thingy. There are different types of null models. You need the right one ;)  

The script is just a simple demonstration of datalogging and contains numerous bad practices such as hardcoded paths to home file system.
